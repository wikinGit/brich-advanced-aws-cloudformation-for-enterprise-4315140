Metadata:
    Intent: This alarm is used to detect the underlying problems with instances,
        including both system status check failures and instance status check
        failures.
    ThresholdJustification: When a status check fails, the value of this metric is
        1. The threshold is set so that whenever the status check fails, the
        alarm is in ALARM state.
Properties:
    AlarmName: AWS/EC2 StatusCheckFailed InstanceId=i-0c61ec733d7d2451b
    AlarmDescription: This alarm helps to monitor both system status checks and
        instance status checks. If either type of status check fails, then this
        alarm should be in ALARM state.
